                        Hi, weâ€™re Misty and Carol, two friends who met growing
                        dahlias. So, when two friends who love dahlias want to
                        make other new friends who also love dahlias, they start
                        a club!

                    <h3>Our Vision for YDS</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had a vision of creating a fun space where people who
                        love dahlias could gather and connect, in person and
                        through social media, to learn, have fun, and enjoy
                        growing dahlias together.
